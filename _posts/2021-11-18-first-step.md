What does one do when he is bored?

Start a blog I guess.

So here I am, taking that first step and starting a new hobby.

Let's see how this goes.

What will I write about?

There are few things I enjoy doing. Reading books and thinking. I guess most of the content here will be around these two themes.

When it comes to books, my interests are diverse. I could be reading a book about Finance and Investments or a biography or history or anything else which catches my interest.

I'm also aggressively pursuing the FIRE goal. I may write about that a bit.
