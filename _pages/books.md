Leave me alone with a book and the concept of time goes into a state of non-existence for me.

I enjoy reading books on anything and everything. Some of my favorite subjects are

- Finance and Investments
- Business
- History
- Technology (Mostly computers and programming)
- Biographies (Technically not a subject)
- Classics

## My rating system

★★★★★ Life Changing. Had a profound impact on me

★★★★ Excellent. Learned stuff I can use in my life

★★★ Good. I learned something I did not know

★★ Meh. I should have done something else

★ Don’t bother. Just don’t
